How to update local branch with info from repo
	git pull origin master --rebase

	IF THERE ARE MERGE CONFLICTS, WE MUST CORRECT THEM MANUALLY
	
	Open the folder .git/rebase-apply/patch

	AFTER THIS IS FIXED, YOU CAN RUN
	git rebase --continue

	THIS WILL LET YOU REVIEW BEFORE YOU OVERWITE ANYTHING THAT IS CONFLICTING
	
	After pulling the changes, re-open the file and manually reformat everything
	(There should be a message in all caps <HEAD> and ===== denoting the changes, remove those)

	Then, readd the files by
	git add *
	git commit -m "Comment here"
	git push origin master


If that does not work, use this command instead
	git pull https://github.com/bzhang908/CPSC233BattleShip.git master
